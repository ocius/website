# Ocius Website v.2 üöÄ

This is improved, redesigned version of Ocius website (https://ocius.com.au). Ocius Technology Ltd (formerly Solar Sailor) is an Australian public unlisted company with Research and Development facilities at the University of NSW. The company is widely recognized in the international marine transportation industry.

## What's changed since v.1? üîç

Ocius started as a yet another WordPress-based website, but later the company management decided to improve website speed. That's how the [Gatsby](https://www.gatsbyjs.com/) framework was chosen. While it did help the speed, the website had the same old design. What you see right now is the work of web designer *Chris Larcombe* ‚Äî he did amazing job, gave a fresh look and feel to the company. Not to mention the help of developer Kevin Chan and me, who spent endless hours polishing the UI, also trying to improve every little bit of code.

Also,

- We removed ~~[Carbon Components](https://www.carbondesignsystem.com/)~~. Unfortunately, this bloated library don't mix very well with styled-components. It added a ton of dead code and unnecessary dependencies, even though we used only a few controls. R.I.P.
- HTML Microdata was added to contact page.
- Better optimization for tablets, mobile devices.
- Some of the bugs were fixed, memory leaks.
- More consistent codebase, code was heavily refactored and simplified.
- **New component** - SideNav ‚≠ê

## Structure üìñ

The project is split into two parts, [main website](https://ocius.com.au) and the [live page](https://ocius.com.au/live). You'll probably just want to head over over there and see them directly on the web. Technologies are used:
- [GatsbyJS](https://www.gatsbyjs.org)
- [AWS Amplify](https://aws.amazon.com/amplify/), hosting
- [Styled Components](https://styled-components.com)
- [Loadable Components](https://loadable-components.com) - only in some places.
