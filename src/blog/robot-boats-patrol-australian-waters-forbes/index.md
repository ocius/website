While the U.S. cautiously experiments with small unmanned craft for extended missions – like the mysterious SHARC photographed off Florida in June – Australia is sending them out on patrol. Except that the Bluebottle, made by Australian company Ocius Technology, is an altogether bigger, faster and more powerful vessel than its American cousin, or the Russian imitator.

“Other Unmanned Surface Vessels do not have the same payload, power and performance we do,” says Robert Dane, CEO of Ocius.

The idea with such Unmanned Surface Vessels or USVs is that they should operate for as long as possible for ‘boring jobs’ as Dane calls them such as long-distance patrols. Ideally they should be able to go for weeks or months for without refueling or recharging. Sydney-based Ocius Technology first developed a concept for an unmanned craft able to stay at sea indefinitely in 2007, and in 2015 the Defense Science and Technology Group awarded a contract for the first Bluebottle prototype, known as Bob. The autonomous, five-mete long vessel which can carry a six-hundred-pound sensor payload, was demonstrated in 2017.

Indefinite endurance demands the ability to harvest energy form the environments. While the SHARC/Wave Glider uses wave energy for propulsion and solar power for its electronics, the Bluebottle – named for an Australian jellyfish — harnesses wind, wave and solar power. While the Wave Glider can only make 1 to 2 knots, Dane says the Bluebottle can make 5 knots.
